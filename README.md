# Hi, I'm Patrick Atef 👋  

## Mechatronics Engineer | Embedded Systems & Android Automotive Developer  

🎓 I graduated from the **Information Technology Institute (ITI)** – Intake **45**,  
specializing in the **Embedded Systems Track** and **Android Automotive Development**.  

💻 Throughout this journey, I’ve built and collaborated on multiple real-world embedded and Android Automotive projects —  
you can explore my full **9-month journey** and its results in my repositories (**"حصاد الـ 9 شهور"** 🌾).  

🚘 My **ITI Graduation Project**: [PAO – Power Of Three](https://github.com/PAO-PowerOfThree)  
A **Tri-System Automotive Architecture** integrating **Bare Metal**, **Embedded Linux (Yocto)**, and **Android Automotive (AOSP)** across multiple in-vehicle displays —  
bridging real-time systems with connected user experiences.
